# Tawba Support Website

This project contains a single-page React experience for the Tawba app support form.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to view the site. Because the page relies on hosted React bundles
rather than ES module imports, it works when opened directly from the file system, and the form will open
your default email client to send the message to ahmadalzein06@gmail.com.
